## FAQ

> Why `super-potato`?

The name super-potato came from a random generator. I liked it. I used it.

> What does `super-potato` do?

IDK yet. I initially intended to write a micro CA using Go to host on Platform.sh. Right now I'm just playing with the Go language, code generation, and the Platform.sh [environment](https://develop-sr3snxi-fteigbda5stns.eu-3.platformsh.site/).

> What can I do to help?

- If you're interested in the original micro CA idea, you can follow along the [design issue](https://github.com/demosdemon/super-potato/issues/11).
- I hate writing documentation, so any pull-requests for documentation will be graciously accepted. However, all commits to `master` must be [signed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work). Unsigned contributions will be squashed on merge.
- Want to see something interesting with the Platform.sh API written in Go? [Open an issue!](https://github.com/demosdemon/super-potato/issues)
- Want to play around with Platform.sh and Go? [Open a pull request!](https://github.com/demosdemon/super-potato/pulls) Thanks to [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/) and its [GitHub integration](https://docs.platform.sh/administration/integrations/github.html#github), all pull requests automatically spawn live replicas of the master environment.
